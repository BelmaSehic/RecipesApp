# Recipes App - README

## Project Overview
Welcome to the **Recipes App**, an app designed to fulfill requirements of the course Introduction to Web Programming.

## MILESTONE 1: Initial Project Setup (23.3.2025)
Milestone 1 focuses on the static frontend, backend skeleton (folders), and database design. The key achievements in this phase include:

### ðŸ“Œ **Frontend**
- Static frontend views (or placeholders for them) which work as a Single Page Application - switching between views without the need to reload the full page.
- Built using Bootstrap template to ensure responsiveness and consistency.
- Separated folders for HTML, CSS and JS.
### ðŸ“Œ **Backend: Skeleton**
- A well-structured backend skeleton with defined folders for **routes, services, and DAO layers**.
- The backend currently serves as a **placeholder** and does not contain any logic or functionality yet.
### ðŸ“Œ **Database: EER Diagram**
- An **Enhanced Entity-Relationship (EER) diagram** that outlines the completed database structure.
- The database is fully designed and ready to support future development efforts.
- Includes tables, relationships, and constraints to ensure data integrity.

-Implemented DAO layer (basic CRUD operations) with classes inheriting from BaseDao for database interactions without having to rewrite the code.
### ðŸ“Œ Routes & Services**
-Defined the necessary routes and services for testing database operations.

Milestone 2 waiting for approval.
